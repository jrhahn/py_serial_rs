py_serial_rs
========================================

The goal of this package is to provide a fast and reliable interface to the serial ports.

Instead of implementing the logic in Python, this package builds around `serialport <https://docs.rs/serialport/latest/serialport/>`_ written in Rust. This package supports threading.


========================================
Installation
========================================
`PyO3 <https://pyo3.rs/v0.18.3/>`_ (with maturin) will build a pip package for you. For this, make
sure that you are able to build rust packages with `cargo`. Create a virtual environment
and install the required pip packages with

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

The pip package can then easily be build with

.. code-block:: bash

   maturin build --release

Voil√†, a pip package to be used in your code!


========================================
Demo Scripts
========================================
Demo scripts are located in `/python`:

* `demo.py` shows a simple direct communication via the serial connection
* `demo_threads.py` demonstrates how this package can be used with threads
